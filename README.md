# English Patch for Waiwai Check and Waiwai Kids

Here are the English patch for 3 Satellaview games (in 2 separate roms):
- WaiWai Check 11/15 Rerun | わいわいチェック 11/15 再放送 ([ROM Download](https://superfamicom.org/blog/2023/02/warios-first-event-and-pirates-that-beeps/))
- Waiwai Check 3/21 | わいわいチェック 3/21
- Yuki no Waiwai Kids 3/16 | 有紀のワイワイKIDS 3/16 ([ROM Download](https://superfamicom.org/blog/2012/11/new-rom-dump-but-i-dont-know-wai-im-releasing-these-now/))

I usually don't provide links to roms, but I make an exception since the Satellaview dumps are hard to find.
Waiwai Check 3/21 and Waiwai Kids 3/16 are contained in the same pack.

The three games are "spot the difference" games using the same engine.
You have an animated image on the left and the mirrored version on the right.
Moving the cursor around you have to find the differences.
Some game modes are based on time, others on score. There is also a 2 player mode.
The "thinking challenge" gives you a ticket with a code at the end, that you could send to the St.GIGA office to be eligible for a prize.
Yuki's Waiwai Kids has no 2 player mode, you play against a ruthless A.I. 

The main menu has an option for Radio ON/Radio OFF (Select Radio OFF to have the in game music) as the game were intended to be played while listening the radio show (After School King).

The game Yuki's Waiwai Kids was part of the radio show Yuki Uchida's Dusk Street Kids	
内田有紀の夕暮れストリートキッズ (Uchida Yuki no Yuugure SutoritoKizzu).
The show was hosted by [Yuki Uchida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Uchida).
